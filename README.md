As a dedicated and detail-oriented DevOps Engineer, I specialize in automating AWS infrastructure, including EC2, S3, VPC, and IAM, utilizing tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins. I possess strong proficiency in managing version control with Git and developing robust CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins.

My skill set includes deploying and maintaining AWS resources, configuring infrastructure with Ansible, and leveraging Docker and Kubernetes for efficient containerization.

I am committed to contributing to dynamic teams, continuously enhancing my expertise in DevOps practices, and driving innovation in infrastructure automation. <!--
